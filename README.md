# Operating System Practical Programs

This repository contains a collection of **Operating System (OS) practical programs** implemented using **Python**.  
These programs are designed as per academic syllabus and help in understanding core OS concepts with simple simulations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand core concepts of Operating Systems
- To simulate OS algorithms using Python
- To gain practical exposure to scheduling, memory, and resource management
- To strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking skills

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- File Access Pattern Analysis
- Cache Strategies (LRU, FIFO)
- Process Scheduling (FCFS)
- Container Scheduling Simulation
- Resource Allocation (CPU & Memory)
- Basic OS-level decision making logic

---

## 🧪 List of Practical Programs

### 🔹 Practical 
**File Access Pattern Monitoring & Cache Strategy Suggestion**
- Analyzes file access patterns
- Suggests suitable cache strategy (LRU or FIFO)

### 🔹 Practical 
**Container Scheduling Simulation (FCFS)**
- Simulates First Come First Serve scheduling
- Demonstrates sequential task execution

### 🔹 Practical 
**Docker Resource Allocation & Scheduling**
- Simulates CPU & Memory allocation
- Decides whether containers can be scheduled or must wait
